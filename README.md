## Project Background

Car theft continues to pose a significant security and economic challenge across India, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas with high vehicle density. In recent years, law enforcement agencies and insurance providers have collected detailed incident-level data capturing theft locations, vehicle characteristics, recovery outcomes, and investigative actions. However, short-term datasets are often under-analyzed despite their value in identifying immediate risks, emerging patterns, and operational gaps.

This project analyzes reported car theft cases in India recorded during the 2023 calendar year and January 2024. The dataset provides a focused, near-term view of theft activity, enabling the identification of recent patterns related to theft timing, geographic concentration, recovery performance, repeat incidents, and the effectiveness of security measures such as GPS and CCTV. The analysis emphasizes practical insights that can support short-term interventions and operational decision-making.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to analyze reported car theft cases in India during 2023 and January 2024 to identify recent theft patterns, high-risk locations and time periods, evaluate vehicle recovery performance, assess the effectiveness of security measures such as GPS and CCTV, examine the prevalence of repeat theft incidents, and measure investigative effectiveness through suspect identification outcomes. The analysis aims to generate actionable insights that support data-driven crime prevention, improved recovery processes, and enhanced investigative decision-making.

## Primary Goal

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights from recent car theft data (2023–January 2024) to support short-term crime prevention, vehicle security awareness, and investigative improvement efforts in India. By focusing on a defined time window, the analysis aims to highlight current risk areas, evaluate the immediate impact of security measures, and identify operational gaps that can be addressed through targeted interventions and data-driven decision-making.

## Project Structure

### Tools Used

-  Postgres SQL - Data exploration and Analysis

-  Power BI - Data Visualisation

### Analysis Questions

1.  What brand of car is most frequently stolen?

2.  Which state does the theft occur more frequently?

3.  What time of the day does the theft most frequently occur?

4.  What is the percentage recovery?

5.  What age group records the highest case of car theft?

6.  How often are there repeat cases?

7.  What is the percentage recovered to not recovered?

8.  Is there preference to the fuel type?

9.  Are the car mostly GPS installed?

10.  Which vehicles have valid insurance and which dont?

11.  What is the suspect identification rate by cctv availability?

12.  What is the suspect identification rate?

13.  What is the rate of repeat theft cases?

14.  How many cases were reported on a monthly basis?

15.  What is the recovery rate by GPS installed?

16.  What locations records the highest number of theft cases?

17.  What is the average period of time to recover the car?

## Insights

-  Toyota vehicles are the most targeted, recording the highest number of reported theft cases during the period under review.

-  Fuel type does not influence theft risk, as no significant preference was observed between petrol, diesel, or other fuel categories.

-  Vehicle thefts occur most frequently in the evening, indicating higher risk during late-day and early-night hours.

-  Vehicle recovery performance is low, with only 30% of stolen cars successfully recovered.

-  Repeat theft is a major concern, as 67% of cases involve vehicles that had been stolen previously, highlighting weak post-theft deterrence.

-  GPS adoption is limited, with 60% of stolen vehicles lacking GPS tracking systems, reducing the likelihood of recovery.

-  Investigative effectiveness is low, as suspects were identified in only 20% of reported cases.

-  Recovery is slow, with an average recovery time of 18 days for stolen vehicles, suggesting delays in investigation and tracking.

## Recommendation

1.  **Target high-risk vehicle brands**
Law enforcement and vehicle owners should prioritize theft prevention strategies for high-risk brands such as Toyota, including enhanced surveillance, owner awareness campaigns, and manufacturer-supported security features.

2.  **Strengthen evening and night patrols**
Since thefts peak in the evening, deploying additional patrols, checkpoints, and surveillance during these hours could significantly reduce incidents.

3.  **Promote GPS installation and usage**
Increased adoption of GPS tracking systems should be encouraged through insurance incentives, regulatory policies, or manufacturer partnerships, as GPS absence is strongly linked to low recovery rates.

4.  **Improve post-recovery security for repeat victims**
Given the high repeat theft rate, recovered vehicles should undergo mandatory or strongly recommended security upgrades (GPS, immobilizers, CCTV coverage at parking locations).

5.  **Enhance CCTV coverage and usability**
Expanding CCTV coverage in high-theft locations and improving footage quality can support faster suspect identification and improve investigative outcomes.

6.  **Accelerate investigation and recovery timelines**
Reducing the average recovery time of 18 days should be a priority by improving inter-agency coordination, data sharing, and real-time tracking mechanisms.

7.  **Focus on investigative capacity building**
The low suspect identification rate suggests a need for improved forensic analysis, digital evidence handling, and technology-driven policing.

## Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that car theft in India during the period under review is characterized by high repeat victimization, low recovery rates, and limited investigative success. The prevalence of repeat thefts suggests that existing deterrence measures are insufficient, particularly after an initial theft occurs. Limited adoption of tracking technologies and inadequate surveillance infrastructure further reduce the likelihood of timely recovery and suspect identification.

To effectively address these challenges, a shift toward technology-driven prevention, targeted policing during high-risk periods, and improved investigative processes is essential. Strengthening GPS and CCTV adoption, prioritizing high-risk vehicle categories, and accelerating recovery timelines can significantly improve outcomes. While the dataset provides valuable short-term insights, sustained data collection and enhanced data granularity will be critical for tracking long-term trends and evaluating the impact of future interventions.
